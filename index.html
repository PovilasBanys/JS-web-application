          <h5 class="features__header">Dark matter</h5>
          <p>
            The evidence for dark matter lies with gravity. Gravity is the force
            or “glue” that holds the universe together. Everything in the
            universe is mutually attracted to everything else. Scientists have
            been able to calculate the total mass of the visible universe. They
            have also calculated the gravitational forces that hold the universe
            together. What they have found is that there does not appear to be
            enough visible matter to account for the mass that is required to
            gravitationally bind the universe together. In addition, dark matter
            can be detected through its gravitational influence on other
            objects, or even on light itself. It can affect the motion of stars
            and galaxies. Many galaxies have been found to be rotating much
            faster that they should. According to Einstein’s theory of gravity,
            they should fly apart. But something unseen seems to be holding them
            together. Dark matter can also affect the path of light. In a
            phenomenon known as gravitational lensing, dense objects can cause
            the light of distant objects to bend around it. This can result in
            distorted images and duplicate images of stars and galaxies. We can
            tell that something is bending the light, but we can’t tell what it
            is.

          <h5 class="features__header">Pulsar</h5>
          <p>
            A pulsar is basically a rapidly spinning neutron star. A neutron
            star is the highly compacted core of a dead star, left behind in a
            supernova explosion. This neutron star has a powerful magnetic
            field. In fact, this magnetic field is about one trillion times as
            powerful as the magnetic field of the Earth. The magnetic field
            causes the neutron star to emit strong radio waves and radioactive
            particles from its north and south poles. These particles can
            include a variety of radiation, including visible light. Pulsars
            that emit powerful gamma rays are known as gamma ray pulsars. If the
            neutron star happens to be aligned so that the poles face the Earth,
            we see the radio waves every time one of the poles rotates into our
            line of sight. It is a similar effect as that of a lighthouse. As
            the lighthouse rotates, its light appears to a stationary observer
            to blink on and off. In the same way, the pulsar appears to be
            blinking as its rotating poles sweep past the Earth. Different
            pulsars pulse at different rates, depending on the size and mass of
            the neutron star. Sometimes a pulsar may have a binary companion. In
            some cases, the pulsar may begin to draw in matter from this
            companion. this can cause the pulsar to rotate even faster. The
            fastest pulsars can pulse at well over a hundred times a second.

          <p>
            The word “nebula” is derived from the Latin word for “clouds”.
            Indeed, a nebula is a cosmic cloud of gas and dust floating in
            space. More than one nebula are called nebulae. Nebulae are the
            basic building blocks of the universe. They contain the elements
            from which stars and solar systems are built. They are also among
            the most beautiful objects in the universe, glowing with rich colors
            and swirls of light. Stars inside these clouds of gas cause them to
            glow with beautiful reds, blues, and greens. These colors are the
            result of different elements within the nebula. Most nebulae are
            composed of about 90% hydrogen, 10% helium, and 0.1% heavy elements
            such as carbon, nitrogen, magnesium, potassium, calcium, iron. These
            clouds of matter are also quite large. In fact, they are among the
            largest objects in the galaxy. Many of them are dozens or even
            hundreds of light-years across. Nebulae have been divided into five
            major categories. These are emission nebulae, reflection nebulae,
            dark nebulae, planetary nebulae, and supernova remnants. Emission
            and reflection nebulae tend to be fuzzy in appearance and lack any
            noticeable shape or structure. They are also known as diffuse
            nebulae.

              suspected. Not only does it extend beyond the Milky Way to untold
              numbers of other galaxies—this would come as a surprise to
              astronomers of the 19th and early 20th century to whom our galaxy
              was “the universe”—but it is expanding faster every day. Now we
              can confidently trace cosmic history back 13.8 billion years to a
              moment only a billionth of a second after the big bang.
              Astronomers have pinned down our universe's expansion rate, the
              mean density of its main constituents, and other key numbers to a
              precision of 1 or 2 percent.

              Gravity, the force that revealed all that dark matter, has proved
              to be nearly as baffling. A pivotal moment came in 1915 when
              Albert Einstein published his general theory of relativity, which
              transcended Isaac Newton's mechanics and revealed that gravity is
              actually the deformation of the fabric of space and time. This new
              theory was slow to take hold. Even after it was shown to be
              correct by observations of a 1919 solar eclipse, many dismissed
              the theory as an interesting quirk—after all, Newton's laws were
              still good enough for calculating most things.

              sky. Some patches are slightly hotter, others slightly cooler. The
              amplitude of these fluctuations is only one part in 100,000, but
